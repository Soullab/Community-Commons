      "framing": "Analyze from Stuart Kauffman's perspective on radical emergence and the adjacent possible. Focus on: What constitutes genuine novelty vs. recombination? What constraints need to be satisfied? What's the phase space of possibilities? How do we detect the unprestatable?"

      "name": "Jung Archetypal Patterns",
      "framing": "Analyze from Jungian depth psychology. Focus on: What archetypal patterns are active? What's emerging from the collective unconscious? What symbols/myths are relevant? How does this serve individuation? What's the shadow dimension?"
